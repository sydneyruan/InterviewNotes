# Interview Notes
Coding Interview Prep, codes are in Python
- [List, Dictionary, Set Time Complexity:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complexity-cheat-sheet-for-python-operations/)
- Space Complexity
- [Python Bitwise Operators:](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| & | AND | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 |
| \| | OR | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 |
| ^ | XOR | Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 |
| ~ | NOT | Inverts all the bits |
| << | Zero fill left shift | Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off |
| >> | Signed right shift | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off |

- Combination & Permutation

| Order? | Repetition? | Formula |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Yes | No | *P(n,r) =* $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ |
| No | No | *C(n,r) =* $\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ |
| Yes | Yes | $n^r$ |
| No | Yes | *C(n+r-1,r) =* $\frac{n+r-1)!}{r!(n-r)!}$ |
